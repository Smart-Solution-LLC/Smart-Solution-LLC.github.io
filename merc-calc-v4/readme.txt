DESIGNED USING CHATGPT- MUCH OF THE CONVO AND VERSIONS OF PYTHON USED IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING INCLUDED HERE. wILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE. 

CURRENT STRUCTURING

1.Create fields for all the data points including:
Listing Price
Shipping Cost (paid by buyer/seller)
Actual Shipping Cost
Sales Tax Percentage (defaulting to 7%, adjustable via dropdown)
Marketing or Promotion Costs
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Discounts offered (as percent or fixed value)
Buyer and seller-specific output summaries

2.JavaScript Expansion:
Calculations to implement:
Revenue Calculations:
Gross Revenue after subtracting the cost of goods, marketing, and shipping.
Calculate buyer fees (like service fee and payment processing).
Seller fees (shipping, promotional costs, taxes).
Summarize Buyer vs Seller Metrics:
Total cost to the buyer, including shipping, tax, and service fees.
Profit for the seller, including gross vs net after accounting for costs.
Percentages of total fees paid.
Optional fee calculations for payout processing (like bank deposit or instant payout).
Visual Representation:
Custom charts using Chart.js or similar to dynamically visualize profit margins, revenue splits, and more based on inputs.

3. Charts & Graphs:
Pie Chart:
Show breakdowns of buyer fees and seller expenses.
Bar Chart:
Show differences between gross revenue, costs, and net profit.
Charts should update as input fields are modified, allowing a dynamic, visual representation.

4. Export Functionality:
Add a button to export all relevant data into a CSV file that could be easily imported into a spreadsheet.
Include calculated fields (like profit margin, revenue breakdowns) to give users the ability to track and adjust pricing externally.
Let Me Share a Draft Version:
I'll provide a working HTML + JavaScript code here that includes all the fields and initial calculations. Then, I'll enhance the visual aspect and add charting/export functionality.
